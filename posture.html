<h1>Posture</h1>

<h2>Maintaining good posture is extremely important</h2>

<p>Today most people have very poor posture. Especially their head posture. Most people suffer from something
    called forward head posture. This is where their head cranes forward, rather than sitting on the base of their spine.
    This is due to our mostly sedentary lifestyles, sitting in front of computers and looking down at our phones.
</p>

<p>To help combat this, you can do exercises to strengthen the small muscles of the neck that are required
    to keep your head in the correct position.
    </p>
